evaluation interval function, and a sensor polling interval function. This work evaluates the RT-IFTTT framework with sensing data that 10 physical sensors collect for 10 days. With the collected data, the evaluation results show that the RTIFTTT framework with the proposed scheduling algorithm executes 100 to 400 applets according to user-defined realtime constraints with up to 64.12% less sensor polling counts compared to the framework with the fixed intervals.
